# Simple-Linear-Regression-on-Predicting-Student-Outcomes
Using historical data from roughly 200 students from a cohort of Year 12 students and creating a simple linear regression to try and predict their final year mark based on the average of their 4 interim assessments.

Situation- in my previous career I had a big spreadsheet of student data and their weekly and half termly assessment marks. Each of the half term assessments would be reported home to parents and what this simple linear regression aims to do (rather crudely) is to try to predict the end of Year 12 exam mark based on the average of the 4 half term assessments.

Of course it is a crude way to predict an end of year 12 exam mark as the 4 half termly assessments are all different in nature, varying in terms of complexity and length. There are also other factors that may be worth investigating (study hours, homework completion rate, attendance) but this is a very simple model.

The data is 3 years old and all student data is anonymised to protect identity of students. Only student IDs are kept and its impossible to use this to find information as these are churned every 2 years and in the final analysis shown these will be redacted. 

Ideally I would like this model to be used at the end of the teaching cycle for departments to use to predict marks and hence can be used to define grade boundaries and plan ahead for Year 13 resources, class sizes as well as potential students who may fail based on the average of their 4 half termly assessments.
